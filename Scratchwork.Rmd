## Variable selection
{I think I don't want to do this}

We ought to spend a whole day on lasoo regression, but for now, it can be one way to do variable selection.

```{r}
lasso_mod <- cv.glmnet(y = gamma_env_impute %>% pull(Gammaproteobacteria),
       x = gamma_env_impute %>% select(-Gammaproteobacteria) %>% as.matrix()
)
lasso_mod %>% coef(., s = "lambda.min")
```
